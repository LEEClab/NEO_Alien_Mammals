# Neotropical Alien Mammals: a dataset of occurrence and abundance of alien mammals in the Neotropics

The NEOTROPICAL ALIEN MAMMALS include a series of data about the composition and distribution of mammal species that were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced by humans into the Neotropics. The dataset has more than 600 collaborators and is composed for more than 73,000 records of alien mammals in 26 countries and Caribbean islands.
The dataset has three files containing published and unpublished data of occurrence ([NEOTROPICAL_ALIEN_MAMMALS_OCCURENCE.csv](https://github.com/LEEClab/NEO_Alien_Mammals/blob/master/DATASET/NEOTROPICAL_ALIEN_MAMMALS_ABUNDANCE_v1_0.csv)) and abundance ([NEOTROPICAL_ALIEN_MAMMALS_ABUNDANCE.csv](https://github.com/LEEClab/NEO_Alien_Mammals/blob/master/DATASET/NEOTROPICAL_ALIEN_MAMMALS_OCCURENCE_v1_0.csv)) of alien mammals. A [third file](https://github.com/LEEClab/NEO_Alien_Mammals/blob/master/DATASET/NEOTROPICAL_ALIEN_MAMMALS_REFERENCES_v1_0.csv) comprises references used to compile the data from the published studies.
